## **Overview**
This project provides automation scripts and playbooks to simplify common sysadmin tasks such as:
- Server provisioning
- Configuration management
- Backup automation
- Monitoring setup

The tools used in this project include:
- **Ansible** for configuration management
- **Shell scripting** for lightweight automation
- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning (optional)

## **Features**
âœ… Automate server setup for both Linux  
âœ… Provision VMs/containers with ease  
âœ… Deploy services like Nginx, Apache, and more  
âœ… Backup automation with `rsync` and `cron`  
âœ… Monitor system resources with custom scripts

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.x** (for Ansible)
- **Ansible** (`pip install ansible`)
- **SSH access** to target servers
- **Git** (to clone this repository)

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dani-fernando/linux-automation.git
   cd linux-automation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure SSH Access**:
   Ensure your SSH key is added to the target servers for passwordless login. You can add your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on each server.

4. **Customize Inventory**:
   Edit the `inventory.yml` file to include the IP addresses or hostnames of your target servers:
   ```yaml
   all:
     hosts:
       server1:
         ansible_host: 192.168.1.10
       server2:
         ansible_host: 192.168.1.11
   ```

## **Usage**

### **1. Run Ansible Playbooks**
To automate server setup using Ansible:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/setup-server.yml
```

### **2. Automate Backups**
Run the backup script manually or schedule it via `cron`:
```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

To schedule daily backups, add the following to your crontab:
```bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/scripts/backup.sh
```

### **3. Monitor Resources**
Run the monitoring script to check CPU usage:
```bash
./scripts/monitor-cpu.sh
```
